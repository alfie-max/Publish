----------------------------------- Design -----------------------------------

      User Interface
==========================

This is what the user would be exposed to

1. publish.post(*args)		-> Takes in various arguments including the
   				   Message, and the channel names and
   				   return their response

2. publish.read(channel)	-> Takes in channel name as argument, returns
   				   the latest (fixed number of) messages from
				   the channel

3. publish.config()		-> Option for configuring the channel/app
   				   specifics


    HANDLER 
===============

This portion of the api would handle all the message parsing to
different channel according to need and at the same time manage their
responses.

1. verify_auth(channel)		-> Verify if user is authenticated for the
   				   channel and returns the response

2. send_to(message,channel)	-> Send the message to corresponding channel
