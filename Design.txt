Publish app has a powerful command line based User-Interface which takes in the user input which is basically the message to be posted and the various networks to which the content should be posted. The user input is then validated to see if thereâ€™s any error or the formatting is correct. After that, the message will be posted in the specified social networks and a success message is displayed to the user.

===================================
Design
===================================

The whole application contains 3 different independent layers :
1) User Interface.
2) App Engine.
3) Network Dispatcher.

1) User-interface is the layer which user-interaction takes place. This layer takes care of the user input and pass it to the next layer.Not only that, the status/error messages are also conveyed to the user via this layer. Users can find general instructions on how to use this application properly.

2)App Engine is the core or the brain of our application. This layer initially takes the user inputted data from the upper layer and validates it. First, it separates the message and channel and then verify whether user input is error-free and in proper format suitable for each networks.If yes, the message is then passed to next layer. Else an error message is reported to the user via the User Interface layer.

3)Network Dispatcher - The validated message supplied by the App Engine is then send to the corresponding social channel for posting it over Internet. If any error occur during this process an error message will be displayed to the user. Else after succesfully posting the content a success message is given to the user.
